This document is a declaration of software quality for **eProsima Fast CDR** based on the guidelines provided in the [ROS 2 REP-2004 document](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html).

# Quality Declaration

**eProsima Fast CDR** is a C++ library that provides two serialization mechanisms.
One is the [standard CDR](https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/02-06-51) serialization mechanism, while the other is a faster implementation that modifies the standard.

**eProsima Fast CDR** claims to be in the **Quality Level 1** category.

Below are the rationales, notes and caveats for this claim, organized by each requirement listed in the [Package Requirements for Quality Level 1 in REP-2004](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2004.html#package-requirements).

A full copy of the license can be found [here](LICENSE).

### Copyright Statements [3.iv]

**eProsima Fast CDR** copyright holder provide a statement of copyright in each source file.

## Testing [4]

### Feature Testing [4.i]

**eProsima Fast CDR** provides tests which simulate typical usage, and they are located in the [`test` directory](test).
New features are required to have tests before being added as stated in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/eProsima/policies/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Current nightly results can be found here:

* Linux [![Linux ci](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Nightly/job/nightly_fastcdr_master_linux/badge/icon?subject=%20%20%20Linux%20CI%20)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/view/Nightly/job/nightly_fastcdr_master_linux/)

### Public API Testing [4.ii]

Each part of the public API has tests, and new additions or changes to the public API require tests before being added.
The tests aim to cover typical usage and corner cases.

### Coverage [4.iii]

[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/jenkins/coverage/cobertura.svg?jobUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fjenkins.eprosima.com%3A8080%2Fjob%2Fnightly_fastcdr_coverage_linux)](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastcdr_coverage_linux)
*eProsima Fast CDR* aims to provide a line coverage **above 95%**.
*Fast CDR* code coverage policy comprises:
1. All contributions to *Fast CDR* must increase (or at least keep) current line coverage.
   This is done to ensure that the **95%** line coverage goal is eventually met.
1. Line coverage regressions are only permitted if properly justified and accepted by maintainers.
1. If the CI system reports a coverage regression after a pull request has been merged, the maintainers must study the case and decide how to proceed, mostly reverting the changes and asking for a more thorough testing of the committed changes.
1. This policy is enforced through the [nightly Fast CDR coverage CI job](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/nightly_fastcdr_coverage_linux/).

As stated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), developers and contributors are asked to run a line coverage assessment locally before submitting a PR.

### Performance [4.iv]

**eProsima Fast CDR** does not provide performance tests.
However, performance is indirectly tested by *eprosima Fast DDS*.

Any performance regression detected in *eprosima Fast DDS* would be analyzed and, in case that it is related to **eProsima Fast CDR** or could be solved modifying this library, changes could be made to the library in order to revert the performance regression.

### Linters and Static Analysis [4.v]

**eProsima Fast CDR** [code style](https://github.com/eProsima/cpp-style) is enforced using [*uncrustify*](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify).
Among the CI tests there are tests that ensures that every pull request is compliant with the code style.
The latest pull request results can be seen [here](http://jenkins.eprosima.com:8080/job/fastcdr_github_uncrustify/lastBuild/).
The tests only check files where changes have been made.
Therefore, the code style is only enforced in some files.
However, the tendency will be to homogenize the older source files to the code style.

**eProsima Fast CDR** uses [Synopsis Coverity static code analysis](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/eprosima-fast-cdr).

**eProsima Fast CDR** uses [CodeQL](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR/security/code-scanning?query=tool%3ACodeQL) to find security issues on the code.

## Dependencies [5]

### Direct Runtime Dependencies [5.iii]

**eProsima Fast CDR** has no run-time or build-time dependencies that need to be considered for this declaration.
